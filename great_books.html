          <p class="lead">Dr. Sheraw's book covers everything you need to know about Calls.  It describes all the colors and the breeders of the newer colors.   Dr Sheraw as been responsible for many of these. Several chapters are written by other experts. Lou Horton covers chapters on breeding and showing.  The information covered on nutrition and feeding has helped me revamp my feeding program with the products available thru my local dealer.  An eight page color photo section is  included. The last part of the book is devoted to showing. </p>
