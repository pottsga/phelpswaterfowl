      <p class="lead"><strong>Ducklings/Eggs</strong> &mdash; I will sell pet quality ducklings starting in the spring. No shipping and don’t ask. No fertile egg sales. </p>
      <p class="lead"><strong>Breeder Birds</strong> &mdash; I offer breeder quality adults starting in May of each year.  Birds can be delivered to any of the shows that I attend.  Pricing depends on quality of birds. All birds must be paid in full prior to delivery.  These are birds capable of producing top offspring.</p>
      <p class="lead"><strong>Show Quality Birds</strong> &mdash; Everyone’s definition of show birds is different. I will not sell a bird that is labeled “show quality”. My breeder birds are priced by quality. And depending on the show, they may do very well for you.</p>
