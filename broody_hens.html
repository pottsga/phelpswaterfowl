      <h5>Using Broody Ducks to Incubate Eggs</h5>
      <hr>

      <ul class="pt-2">
        <li>I like to use Broody ducks to incubate eggs. The breed I prefer are the Muscovys.  And yes I do use them for call eggs, not to mention the heavier breeds.  I’ve also used Blue Swedish and Mallards.  There are other breeds that make good mothers.</li>
        <li>I like to separate my Muscovys so they each have their own nesting spot.  It’s best if it’s dark and private.  I allow them to lay their own eggs and go broody.  There is no mistake when a Muscovy hen is broody.  She will make high-pitched pips and walk around with her feathers ruffled.  She may do this for a day or two before she is ready to sit full time.</li>
        <li>I allow them to sit on their own eggs for 4-7 days while I collect fertile eggs that I want them to incubate, or I remove fertile eggs from my incubator.</li>
        <li>I return to the nest area after dark and remove the eggs she is sitting on and replace them with foster eggs.  They are much calmer when it is dark.</li>
        <li>I return at the 7day point at night and candle the eggs.</li>
        <li>When placing bantam or call eggs, I usually put 10 eggs under the hen.  I have found that with only 10 they can step around the eggs and don’t put their feet on them.  If I’m replacing the eggs with a larger breed of duck, I usually go with 15.  That way I know the duck is covering all the eggs.</li>
        <li>Always know your hatch date so that ducklings can be removed.</li>
        <li>I also use chickens for my call eggs. Some birds are better than others. The danger being that they may kill the ducklings.</li>
      </ul>
